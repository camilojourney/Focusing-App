cargo --version   # Should show Rust version
npm --version     # Should show npm version
```

### 2. Test the App üß™

```bash
cd /Users/camilomartinez/github/Focusing-App

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### 3. Complete Your First Session üéØ

1. When app opens, enter a goal: "Test my new focus app"
2. Click "Start Session"
3. Wait 1 minute (or change settings to 1-min check-ins for testing)
4. When check-in appears, click any status button
5. Verify the session resumes

### 4. Verify Data Logging ‚úÖ

```bash
# Check that log file was created
ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/

# View the logged data
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl

# Pretty-print with jq (install if needed: brew install jq)
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl | jq .
```

**Expected output:**
```json

- Notice what types of goals work best
- Experiment with check-in intervals

### Week 3: Optimization
**Goal:** Refine your settings
- Adjust session duration based on your actual work blocks
- Try different check-in intervals (10 min? 20 min?)
- Refine how you write goals (specific vs. general)
- Use notes field more actively

### Week 4: Comprehensive Analysis
**Goal:** Extract insights

Run full analysis:
```bash
python3 analyze_focus_data.py

# Install visualization dependencies
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Generate charts
python3 analyze_focus_data.py
```

**Calculate:**
- Overall on-task rate (goal: 60%+ is good!)
- Most productive hours (when to schedule deep work)
- Biggest distraction triggers
- Goals that correlate with high focus

---

## After One Month üéì

### Data Review Session

Set aside 30 minutes to review your data:

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What's my average on-task rate?
2. When am I most focused? (time of day)
3. What types of tasks lead to better focus?
4. What are my most common distractions?
5. How does my focus trend over the month?

**Actionable Insights:**
- Schedule deep work during your peak hours
- Block distracting sites during vulnerable times
- Adjust work environment based on triggers
- Refine your goal-setting approach

### Share Your Results (Optional)

If you want feedback or want to help others:

**What to Build:**
1. **Web Dashboard** (separate HTML page or React app)
   - Connect to your `focus_log.jsonl` file
   - Display real-time metrics
   - Show charts and trends
   - Calculate focus score

2. **Key Metrics:**
   - On-task percentage (overall, by day, by hour)
   - Distraction breakdown (pie chart)
   - Focus trends over time (line chart)
   - Goal achievement tracking
   - Session completion rate

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Filter by date range
   - Compare weeks/months
   - Exportable reports (PDF/CSV)
   - Streak tracking ("5 days of 70%+ on-task!")

**Technology Options:**
- Simple: Add a new HTML page to existing Tauri app
- Advanced: Build React/Vue dashboard
- Data science: Jupyter notebook with visualizations

---

## Phase 3 Planning ü§ñ

Once you have 2-3 months of data, Phase 3 becomes possible.

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Insights

**What to Build:**
1. **Prediction Model:**
   - Predict likelihood of distraction at current time
   - Recommend optimal check-in interval
   - Suggest best times for focused work
   - Identify trigger patterns

2. **Machine Learning Approach:**
   - Features: time of day, goal type, previous status, day of week
   - Target: "Will next check-in be on-task?"
   - Model: Logistic regression, Random Forest, or simple neural net
   - Tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

3. **Training Data:**
   - Your `focus_log.jsonl` is already perfect for this
   - Each entry is a labeled training example
   - 2-3 months = 500-1000+ data points

**Example Insights:**
- "You're 80% likely to be distracted right now. Consider a break?"
- "Your on-task rate drops 35% after 2pm. Schedule deep work before noon."
- "Goals with 'write' are 2x more focused than 'review' tasks."

## Phase 4 Planning üéØ

With AI insights, Phase 4 adds smart interventions.

### Phase 4: Adaptive Focus System

**What to Build:**
1. **Dynamic Check-ins:**
   - Shorter intervals when distraction risk is high
   - Longer intervals during peak focus times
   - Context-aware reminders

2. **Proactive Interventions:**
   - Block distracting sites before you visit them
   - Suggest breaks before burnout
   - Encourage task switching when stuck
   - Celebrate focus streaks

3. **Integration:**
   - Connect with RescueTime, Freedom, or Cold Turkey
   - Sync with calendar (no check-ins during meetings)
   - Integrate with Notion/Obsidian for goal tracking
   - Export to Beeminder or Habitica for accountability

**Question 1: What check-in interval feels right?**
- Try: 10 min (high awareness), 15 min (balanced), 30 min (deep flow)
- Decide: Based on your work style

**Question 2: How detailed should goals be?**
- Option A: Specific ("Write 500 words of intro")
- Option B: General ("Work on thesis")
- Experiment: Try both and see what correlates with focus

**Question 3: How to handle breaks?**
- Strategy A: Include breaks in session (click "Taking a Break")
- Strategy B: Pause session during breaks
- Consider: What gives you better data?

### Medium-term Decisions (This Month)

**Question 4: Desktop switching - keep or remove?**
- If helpful: Keeps focus space separate
- If annoying: Comment out the code
- Alternative: Switch to specific app instead

**Question 5: Should I track multiple projects?**
- Current: One goal per session
- Future: Add project tags or categories
- Consider: Does this add value or complexity?

### Long-term Decisions (Next 3 Months)

**Question 6: Build Phase 2 or jump to Phase 3?**
- Phase 2: Easier, immediate visual feedback
- Phase 3: More interesting, but needs more data
- Hybrid: Simple dashboard + basic predictions

## Final Thoughts üí≠

You've built something powerful here. This isn't just a timer app - it's a **metacognitive tool** that helps you understand your own mind.

**The real value isn't in the app itself, but in:**
1. The awareness it creates (seeing your goal vs. reality)
2. The data it collects (objective truth about your focus)
3. The insights it enables (patterns you couldn't see before)
4. The improvements it drives (data-informed behavior change)

**Remember:**
- Be honest with yourself (the data is for you, not anyone else)
- Don't judge yourself harshly (just observe)
- Focus on trends, not individual check-ins
- Use insights to design better systems, not to feel guilty

**Most importantly:**
The goal isn't to be 100% on-task all the time. That's impossible and unhealthy. The goal is to:
- Be **aware** of when you're focused vs. distracted
- Understand **why** you get distracted
- Design **systems** that support your natural rhythms
- Make **data-informed** decisions about your work
