## Overview

Focus Time is a productivity app that combines long-form focus sessions with periodic check-ins to help you maintain awareness and intentionality throughout your work. Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, Focus Time is designed for extended deep work sessions (default 12 hours) gzxadr

**Phase 1 "Self-Aware MVP" is now complete!** The app tracks your intentions vs. actual behavior, creating a data foundation for future AI-powered insights. See [PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md](PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details.

### Key Features

- **Session Goal Tracking**: Set your intention at the start of each session
- **Interactive Check-ins**: Report what you're actually doing at each check-in point
- **Cognitive Awareness**: See your goal displayed when checking in - creates powerful metacognition
- **Data Logging**: All check-ins are logged locally to JSONL format for future analysis
- **Status Tracking**: On Task, Social Media, Email/Chat, Other Distractions, or Taking a Break
- **Accountability Box**: Answer deep reflection questions and save them to your personal accountability log
- **Automatic Desktop Switching**: Switches to Desktop 1 on macOS during check-ins for a clean reflection space
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Always-accessible timer display in your macOS menu bar
- **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences are saved between sessions
- **Privacy First**: All data stored locally only - no cloud sync, complete privacy

## How It Works

### The Focus Session Flow

1. **Set Your Goal**: Enter what you want to accomplish (e.g., "Finish chapter 4 of my thesis")
2. **Start Session**: Begin your focus timer. Both the session timer and check-in countdown start.
3. **Check-in Triggered**: When the check-in interval is reached (default: 15 minutes):
   - Session automatically pauses
   - Desktop switches to Desktop 1 (macOS)
   - Check-in screen appears showing your goal
4. **Report Status**: Click what you're actually doing:
   - ‚úÖ On Task
   - üì± Social Media (distraction)
   - üìß Email/Chat (distraction)
   - üîÄ Other Distraction
   - ‚òïÔ∏è Taking a Break
5. **Optional Notes**: Add a quick reflection or note
6. **Data Logged**: Your response is saved to a local JSONL file
7. **Auto-Resume**: Session automatically resumes after you respond (or after 20s timeout)
8. **Repeat**: Continue until the full session duration is complete

### Default Settings

- **Session Duration**: 720 minutes (12 hours)
- **Check-in Interval**: 15 minutes
- **Write Time**: 20 seconds

All settings can be customized through the settings window.

2. Adjust your preferences:
   - **Session Duration**: Total focus time in minutes
   - **Check-in Interval**: How often to pause for reflection
   - **Write Time**: Duration of reflection period in seconds
3. Click "Save Settings" to apply changes

## Architecture

### Backend (Rust)

The Rust backend ([src-tauri/src/main.rs](src-tauri/src/main.rs)) handles:

- **Settings Management**: Load and save user preferences to disk
- **System Tray**: Menu bar integration and timer display
- **Window Management**: Show/hide application windows
- **Desktop Switching**: Execute AppleScript commands for macOS desktop control
- **IPC Commands**: Expose functions to the frontend via Tauri's command system

**Key Tauri Commands:**
- `get_settings()` - Retrieve saved settings
- `save_settings()` - Persist user preferences
- `open_settings()` - Launch settings window
- `switch_desktop()` - Execute desktop switch via AppleScript
- `update_tray_timer()` - Update menu bar display

### Frontend (JavaScript)

The frontend ([src/index.html](src/index.html)) manages:

- **Session State**: Track timers and session status
- **UI Updates**: Real-time display of elapsed time, remaining time, and check-ins
- **Timer Logic**: Coordinate session timer, check-in intervals, and write time
- **User Interactions**: Handle button clicks and state transitions

**State Management:**
```javascript
sessionTimeRemaining      // Total session countdown
checkInTimeRemaining      // Next check-in countdown
writeTimeRemaining        // Writing mode countdown
isSessionRunning          // Active session flag
isWriting                 // Writing mode flag
```

### Communication Flow

```
Frontend (HTML/JS) <---> Tauri IPC <---> Backend (Rust) <---> System (macOS)
     |                                        |
     |                                        |
  UI Updates                            File I/O, Tray,
  Timers                                Desktop Switching
```

## Platform Notes

### macOS

Full functionality including automatic desktop switching via AppleScript.

### Windows/Linux

The app can be compiled for Windows and Linux, but the desktop switching feature uses macOS-specific AppleScript commands. Alternative implementations would be needed for full cross-platform support.

## Configuration Files

Settings and data are stored in a platform-specific configuration directory:

**macOS:**
- Settings: `~/Library/Application Support/com.focustime.app/settings.json`
- Log data: `~/Library/Application Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl`
- Accountability Box: `~/Library/Application Support/com.focustime.app/accountability_box.jsonl`

**Linux:**
- Settings: `~/.config/focus-time/settings.json`
- Log data: `~/.config/focus-time/focus_log.jsonl`
- Accountability Box: `~/.config/focus-time/accountability_box.jsonl`

**Windows:**
- Settings: `%APPDATA%\com.focustime.app\settings.json`
- Log data: `%APPDATA%\com.focustime.app\focus_log.jsonl`
- Accountability Box: `%APPDATA%\com.focustime.app\accountability_box.jsonl`

### Settings Format

The settings file is JSON formatted:
```json
{
  "session_duration": 720,
  "check_in_interval": 15,
  "write_time": 20
}
```

### Log Data Format

Each check-in creates one line in the JSONL (JSON Lines) file:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T21:30:00.123Z",
  "session_goal": "Finish chapter 4 of my thesis",
  "reported_status": "On Task",
  "notes": "Making good progress",
  "session_duration_setting": 720,
  "check_in_interval_setting": 15,
  "write_time_setting": 20,
  "check_in_number": 5
}
```

This format is perfect for data analysis with Python, R, or any data tool.

### Accountability Box Format

The Accountability Box stores your reflection answers in JSONL format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T22:30:00.123Z",
  "q1_accomplished": "Completed the tray icon fix and implemented accountability feature",
  "q2_challenges": "Had to debug icon loading issues with Tauri",
  "q3_tomorrow": "Add data visualization for the accountability responses",
  "q4_focus_rating": "8/10 - stayed mostly on task with good flow",
  "q5_learned": "Learned how to create PNG files programmatically in Python"
}
```

**The 5 Accountability Questions:**
1. What did you accomplish today?
2. What challenges did you face?
3. What will you do tomorrow?
4. How focused were you? (1-10)
5. What did you learn?

These questions help you reflect on your work and build self-awareness over time.

## Development

### Hot Reload Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Tauri development server with hot reload for both frontend and backend changes.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates an optimized production bundle in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Modifying the UI

Edit files in the `src/` directory:
- [src/index.html](src/index.html) - Main timer interface
- [src/settings.html](src/settings.html) - Settings dialog

### Modifying Backend Logic

Edit [src-tauri/src/main.rs](src-tauri/src/main.rs) for:
- Tauri commands
- System tray behavior
- Settings persistence
- Desktop switching logic

## Use Cases

Focus Time is ideal for:

- **Deep Work Practitioners**: Long focus sessions with mindful check-ins
- **Writers**: Extended writing sessions with periodic reflection
- **Developers**: Full-day coding sessions with awareness breaks
- **Researchers**: Long study sessions with progress tracking
- **Anyone**: Looking to build intentionality into their focused work

## Data Analysis

After using Focus Time for a while, you can analyze your focus patterns using the logged data.

### Viewing Your Data

```bash
# macOS - view your log file
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl

# Validate JSON format (requires jq: brew install jq)
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl | jq .
```

### Python Analysis Example

```python
import json
from collections import Counter

# Read all log entries
with open('focus_log.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    entries = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

# Calculate on-task percentage
on_task = sum(1 for e in entries if e['reported_status'] == 'On Task')
total = len(entries)
print(f"On-task rate: {on_task/total*100:.1f}%")

# Find most common distractions
statuses = [e['reported_status'] for e in entries]
print(Counter(statuses).most_common())

# Analyze by time of day
import datetime
for entry in entries:
    dt = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(entry['timestamp'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
    print(f"{dt.hour:02d}:00 - {entry['reported_status']}")
```

### Excel/Google Sheets Import

1. Open your JSONL file in a text editor
2. Each line is a separate JSON object
3. Use Excel's "Power Query" or Google Sheets' "ImportJSON" to parse
4. Create pivot tables for:
   - Status distribution
   - Time-of-day patterns
   - Goal achievement tracking

### Insights You Can Discover

- **Focus Patterns**: What times of day are you most focused?
- **Distraction Triggers**: What types of distractions are most common?
- **Goal Correlation**: Do certain types of goals lead to better focus?
- **Session Optimization**: Is 15-minute check-in interval optimal for you?
- **Behavioral Trends**: How does your focus change over days/weeks?

## Customization Ideas

Here are some ways you could extend Focus Time:

**Current Roadmap:**
- **Phase 2**: Data visualization dashboard with charts and metrics
- **Phase 3**: AI-powered predictions and personalized insights
  - **Accountability Box**: Click the "Accountability Box" button to answer reflection questions and save them to your personal accountability log
- **Phase 4**: Smart interventions based on your patterns

**Other Ideas:**
- Add sound notifications for check-ins
- Integrate with note-taking apps during write time
- Track and visualize focus session history
- Add different timer presets (short, medium, long sessions)
- Include focus metrics and analytics
- Support for different reflection prompts at check-in
- Cross-platform desktop switching implementations
- Export reports (daily/weekly summaries)
- Gamification with streaks and achievements
