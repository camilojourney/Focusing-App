## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Goal Tracking
- Input field on main screen for session intention
- Goal displayed prominently during check-ins
- Creates cognitive awareness of intention vs. action

### 2. Interactive Check-in System
- Replaces passive 20-second countdown
- Shows 5 status buttons with emojis
- Optional notes field for quick reflections
- Auto-submit if no response after countdown

### 3. Data Logging
- Logs every check-in to `focus_log.jsonl`
- JSON Lines format (one entry per line)
- Stored in platform-specific config directory
- Includes timestamp, goal, status, notes, settings, check-in number

### 4. Psychology-Based Design
- Displays goal when asking "What are you doing?"
- Forces conscious acknowledgment of distraction
- Creates metacognitive awareness
- Intervention mechanism, not just tracking

## Data Structure

Each check-in creates this log entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T21:30:00.123Z",
  "session_goal": "Finish chapter 4 of my thesis",
  "reported_status": "On Task",
  "notes": "Making good progress on the introduction",
  "session_duration_setting": 720,
  "check_in_interval_setting": 15,
  "write_time_setting": 20,
  "check_in_number": 5
}
```

## File Locations

**macOS:**
- Log data: `~/Library/Application Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl`
- Settings: `~/Library/Application Support/com.focustime.app/settings.json`

**Linux:**
- Log data: `~/.config/focus-time/focus_log.jsonl`
- Settings: `~/.config/focus-time/settings.json`

**Windows:**
- Log data: `%APPDATA%\com.focustime.app\focus_log.jsonl`
- Settings: `%APPDATA%\com.focustime.app\settings.json`

## How to Use

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Ensure Rust is installed
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Daily Workflow

1. **Set Goal**: Enter your session intention
2. **Start Session**: Click "Start Session" button
3. **Work**: Focus on your task
4. **Check-in**: Every 15 minutes:
   - Desktop switches to Desktop 1
   - Check-in screen shows your goal
   - Click your current status
   - Optionally add notes
   - Session auto-resumes
5. **Repeat**: Continue until session complete

### After 1 Month

Analyze your data:

```bash
# Run the analysis script
python3 analyze_focus_data.py

# Or manually view the data
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl | jq .
```

## Data Analysis Tools

### Included Python Script

Run `python3 analyze_focus_data.py` to get:
- Total check-ins and date range
- Status distribution with percentages
- On-task rate calculation
- Time of day analysis
- Goal-based analysis
- Visual charts (if matplotlib installed)

### Install Visualization Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Example Insights

After using the app, you can answer:
- What's my on-task percentage?
- When am I most focused? (time of day)
- What are my most common distractions?
- Which goals lead to better focus?
- How does my focus trend over time?

## Technical Details

### Why JSONL Format?

**Advantages:**
- Each line is independent (fault-tolerant)
- Easy to append without rewriting entire file
- Streamable for large datasets
- Compatible with all data tools (Python, R, jq, etc.)
- Human-readable for debugging

### File Growth Estimate

- 15-min check-ins = 4 per hour
- 12-hour session = 48 check-ins
- ~500 bytes per entry
- **Daily**: ~24 KB
- **Monthly**: ~720 KB (negligible)
- **Yearly**: ~8.6 MB (very small)

### Privacy & Security

- âœ… All data stored locally only
- âœ… No cloud sync or external connections
- âœ… No analytics sent anywhere
- âœ… Complete user control and ownership
- âœ… Easy to backup (just copy the JSONL file)
- âœ… Easy to delete (remove the config directory)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start:**
```bash
# Ensure Rust is installed
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Try again
npm run dev
```

**Check-in screen doesn't appear:**
- Check browser console (Cmd+Option+I in dev mode)
- Verify timer is counting down
- Try setting interval to 1 minute for testing

**Desktop switching doesn't work:**
- macOS only feature
- Requires accessibility permissions
- Test with "Test Switch" button
- Ensure you have multiple desktops set up

**Log file not created:**
- Verify app has write permissions
- Check for errors in console
- Manually create directory if needed:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/
  ```

**JSON parsing errors:**
- Validate with `jq`:
  ```bash
  cat focus_log.jsonl | jq .
  ```
- If a line is corrupted, manually edit or remove it

## Success Metrics

After 1 month of use, you should have:

âœ… **Quantitative:**
- 30+ days of data collected
- 200+ check-in entries (varies by usage)
- Valid JSONL file with no errors
