# Phase 1: Self-Aware MVP - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Phase 1 has been successfully implemented! Your Focus Time app is now a **data-collection tool** that tracks your intentions vs. actual behavior during focus sessions. This creates the foundation for future AI-powered insights.

## What Was Built

### 1. Session Goal Input
- Added a "Your Goal for this Session" input field on the main screen
- Users set their intention at the start of each session
- Example: "Finish chapter 4 of my thesis" or "Debug the user auth module"

### 2. Enhanced Check-in Screen

The 20-second passive countdown has been replaced with an interactive check-in form:

**Display Elements:**
- Shows your original session goal at the top
- Creates cognitive dissonance when you see the gap between intention and action
- Countdown timer continues in the background

**Status Buttons:**
- ‚úÖ On Task
- üì± Social Media (distraction)
- üìß Email/Chat (distraction)
- üîÄ Other Distraction
- ‚òïÔ∏è Taking a Break

**Additional Fields:**
- Optional notes input for quick reflections
- Auto-submit after countdown if no response

### 3. Data Logging System

**Log File Location:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl`
- Linux: `~/.config/focus-time/focus_log.jsonl`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\com.focustime.app\focus_log.jsonl`

**Log Entry Format (JSON Lines):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T21:30:00.123Z",
  "session_goal": "Finish chapter 4 of my thesis",
  "reported_status": "Social Media",
  "notes": "Quick Twitter break",
  "session_duration_setting": 720,
  "check_in_interval_setting": 15,
  "write_time_setting": 20,
  "check_in_number": 3
}
```

Each check-in creates one line in the JSONL file. This format is:
- Easy to parse with any programming language
- Human-readable
- Perfect for feeding into data analysis tools or future AI models

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes ([src/index.html](src/index.html))

**New UI Components:**
1. Goal input field with styling
2. Separate check-in screen (toggles with main screen)
3. Status buttons with emojis
4. Notes input field
5. Countdown display during check-in

**New JavaScript Functions:**
- `showCheckInScreen()` - Displays check-in interface with session goal
- `hideCheckInScreen()` - Returns to main timer view
- `handleCheckInResponse(status)` - Creates log entry and saves to backend
- `updateCheckInCountdown()` - Updates remaining time display

**Modified Functions:**
- `triggerCheckIn()` - Now shows interactive screen instead of passive countdown
- `endWriteTime()` - Hides check-in screen and resumes session

### Backend Changes ([src-tauri/src/main.rs](src-tauri/src/main.rs))

**New Imports:**
- `OpenOptions` - For append-mode file writing
- `Write` trait - For writeln! macro

**New Functions:**
- `log_file_path(app: &AppHandle)` - Returns path to focus_log.jsonl
- `log_check_in(app: AppHandle, log_line: String)` - Tauri command that appends log entry

**File Operations:**
- Creates config directory if it doesn't exist
- Opens log file in append mode (creates if missing)
- Writes each entry as a new line with automatic newline character

## The Psychology Behind It

### Cognitive Awareness Mechanism

The design creates a powerful psychological effect:

1. **Set Intention**: You write your goal ("Finish chapter 4")
2. **Work Happens**: 15 minutes pass
3. **Confrontation**: Check-in shows your goal next to "What are you doing?"
4. **Metacognition**: You must consciously acknowledge if you're off-task
5. **Refocus**: The act of clicking "Social Media" makes you aware of the loop

This isn't just data collection - it's an **intervention mechanism**. The simple act of acknowledging distraction makes you more likely to close that tab and refocus.

## How to Use It

### First Run

1. **Install Rust** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start Session**: Enter your goal for the session
2. **Click "Start Session"**
3. **Work**: Focus on your task
4. **Check-in Occurs**: Every 15 minutes (configurable):
   - Desktop switches to Desktop 1
   - Check-in screen appears
   - See your goal displayed
   - Click your current status
   - Optionally add notes
   - Session auto-resumes
5. **Repeat**: Continue until session complete

### After 1 Month

After using the app for a month, you'll have rich data to analyze:

```bash
# View your log file
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl
```

**Example Analysis Questions:**
- What percentage of check-ins were "On Task"?
- What time of day am I most distracted?
- What types of goals correlate with higher focus?
- How does check-in frequency affect my focus?
- What's my distraction pattern? (Social ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Other?)

## Data Analysis Examples

### Python Analysis (Simple)

```python
import json

# Read all log entries
with open('focus_log.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    entries = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

# Calculate on-task percentage
on_task = sum(1 for e in entries if e['reported_status'] == 'On Task')
total = len(entries)
print(f"On-task rate: {on_task/total*100:.1f}%")

# Find most common distraction
from collections import Counter
distractions = [e['reported_status'] for e in entries
                if 'distract' in e['reported_status'].lower()]
print(Counter(distractions).most_common(3))
```

### Excel/Google Sheets

1. Import the JSONL file (each line is a separate JSON object)
2. Parse into columns
3. Create pivot tables:
   - Status distribution
   - Time-of-day analysis
   - Goal achievement tracking

## Technical Notes

### Why JSONL (JSON Lines)?

Each line is a valid JSON object, making it:
- **Streamable**: Process one entry at a time
- **Appendable**: No need to rewrite entire file
- **Fault-tolerant**: Corrupted line doesn't break whole file
- **Tool-friendly**: Works with jq, Python, R, etc.

### File Growth

**Estimate**:
- 15-minute check-ins = 4 per hour
- 12-hour session = 48 check-ins
- ~500 bytes per entry
- **Daily usage**: ~24 KB
- **Monthly usage**: ~720 KB (negligible)

### Privacy

All data is stored **locally only**:
- No cloud sync
- No analytics sent anywhere
- Complete privacy and control
- You own your data

## Testing Checklist

Before your 1-month trial, verify:

- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Can enter session goal
- [ ] Timer counts down correctly
- [ ] Check-in screen appears after interval
- [ ] Session goal displays on check-in screen
- [ ] All 5 status buttons work
- [ ] Notes field accepts input
- [ ] Countdown timer works during check-in
- [ ] Session resumes after check-in
- [ ] Log file is created at correct location
- [ ] Each check-in creates a new log entry
- [ ] JSON format is valid

**Verify Log File:**
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/

# View contents (should be valid JSON on each line)
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl

# Validate JSON (install jq first: brew install jq)
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.focustime.app/focus_log.jsonl | jq .
```

## Troubleshooting

### Log File Not Created
- Check app has write permissions to config directory
- Look for errors in browser console (Cmd+Option+I in dev mode)
- Verify `log_check_in` command is registered in main.rs

### Check-in Screen Not Showing
- Verify `showCheckInScreen()` is called in `triggerCheckIn()`
- Check CSS classes are applied correctly
- Look for JavaScript errors in console

### Desktop Switch Not Working
- macOS only feature
- Requires accessibility permissions
- Test with "Test Switch" button first

## Questions?

Common questions and answers:

**Q: Can I change the check-in interval?**
A: Yes! Use the Settings button. Default is 15 minutes.

**Q: What if I miss a check-in?**
A: It auto-submits as "No Response (Auto)" after the countdown.

**Q: Can I disable desktop switching?**
A: Yes, comment out the `invoke('switch_desktop')` line in index.html

**Q: How do I export/backup my data?**
A: Just copy the focus_log.jsonl file from the config directory

**Q: Can I use this on multiple devices?**
A: Yes, but each device has its own log file (no sync yet)

## Success Metrics for Phase 1

After 1 month, you should have:
- ‚úÖ 30+ days of data
- ‚úÖ Hundreds of check-in entries
- ‚úÖ Clear patterns emerging
- ‚úÖ Increased metacognitive awareness
- ‚úÖ Foundation for AI model training
